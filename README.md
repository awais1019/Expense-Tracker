### Learning MVVM and Best Practices

The primary goal of this project is to learn and apply the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern in Android development. By structuring the application using MVVM, the project aims to:

- **Separate Concerns:** Clearly separate the UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model) layers, promoting maintainability and testability.
- **Improve Code Organization:** Ensure that the application is organized in a way that makes it easier to manage and extend.
- **Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to modern Android development best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications.
